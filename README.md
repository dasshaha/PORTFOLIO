About Me
Hello! My name is Daria Tsurkina.
Frontend Developer / Big Data & ML Student
Moscow / Open to internships and remote work

Professional Profile
I am a 3rd-year Bachelor's student majoring in Big Data and Machine Learning, with practical experience in frontend development.
I create functional and visually appealing web interfaces. My key goal is to combine expertise in interface development with data analytics to build "smart" user-centric products.

I have experience in the full development cycle of a pet project — from concept and layout to basic business logic in JavaScript.
I am actively learning the modern tech stack (React, Node.js) to implement more complex full-stack solutions.

Key Project: CRoute — Personalized Travel Route Generator
A service for creating custom walking routes based on user preferences (city, style, activity, time, budget).

My contribution (basic full‑stack level):

Frontend: Independently developed an intuitive 4‑page interface (home, settings, route, articles) with responsive layout using HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid) and vanilla JavaScript.

Logic: Implemented parameter selection, validation, and data transfer between pages via Local Storage.

Integration: Connected an interactive map (Leaflet.js) to visualize the route with points of interest and path lines.

UX/UI: Designed the user flow, added interactive elements (article carousel, option selectors), and created content.

Tech stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Leaflet.js, Local Storage API, Figma (mockups), Git.

Next steps: I plan to refactor the project to React for better code structure, develop the backend part with Node.js/Express, and integrate AI for generating unique routes.
